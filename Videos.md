# Videos  
In this document, all videos related to the simulators are provided, along with a brief description of each video.

- [aKaReZa 17 - Simulation, Introduction](https://youtu.be/VqN2q2Agd-M)  
  ---  
  In this video, we explore the definition, advantages, and disadvantages of simulation. We then introduce and compare several popular and widely used simulation software tools for electrical engineering.

- [aKaReZa 19 - Simulation, Proteus, DC Analysis](https://youtu.be/DNlR-f8oeuQ)  
  ---  
  In this video, we learn how to create a new project in Proteus, find and use key components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors, MOSFETs, diodes, and transformers, and perform DC analysis in Proteus.

- [aKaReZa 32 - Simulation, Proteus, Transient & AC Analysis](https://youtu.be/yoHRWpZNOko)  
  ---  
  In this video, we learn how to perform transient and frequency response analysis in Proteus.

- [aKaReZa 39 - Simulation, LTspice, Fast and Easy](https://youtu.be/E33UTtZUTCQ)  
  ---  
  In this video, we learn how to quickly bring all desired components into the LTSpice simulator and then perform DC analysis, transient analysis, and frequency response analysis.

- [aKaReZa 48 - Simulation, TINA, Fast and Easy](https://youtu.be/6yHGW2FJB5s)  
  ---  
  In this video, we learn how to quickly bring all desired components into the TINA simulator and then perform DC analysis, transient analysis, and frequency response analysis.

- [aKaReZa 62 - Simulation, MultiSim, Fast and Easy](https://youtu.be/FBaFGeCysRk)  
  ---  
  In this video, we learn how to quickly select desired components in the MultiSim simulator, perform DC analysis, transient analysis, and frequency response analysis. We also explore the unique features of this simulator and its advantages over other general simulators.

- [aKaReZa 99 - Simulation, Altium Designer, Fast and Easy](https://youtu.be/oy_LQTaLBMg)  
  ---  
  In this video, learn how to simulate electronic circuits in Altium Designer. From installing simulation tools to performing various analyses like DC, Transient, DC Sweep, and AC Analysis, everything is covered to help you test your designs accurately and effortlessly before building.
