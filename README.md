# Simulation
This repository offers a comprehensive guide to mastering popular circuit simulation software, from beginner-friendly introductions to advanced analysis techniques.  We explore each simulator, starting with its interface and features, then covering component selection and usage, and finally, in-depth circuit analysis.

The following simulators are covered:
*   Proteus
*   LTSpice
*   TINA
*   Matlab Simulink
*   Altium Designer
*   PSIM
*   Plecs
*   Ansys Maxwell

Our structured learning approach for each simulator includes:
1.  **Environment Exploration:** Understanding the software's interface, tools, and functionalities, including menus, toolbars, and windows.
2.  **Component Handling:** Learning to locate, select, and use components, including component libraries, placement, and parameter configuration.
3.  **DC Analysis:** Performing DC analysis to determine a circuit's DC operating point, including setting up sources, defining parameters, and interpreting results.
4.  **Transient Analysis:** Observing circuit behavior over time by setting up time-dependent sources, defining simulation duration, and analyzing waveforms.
5.  **AC Analysis/Frequency Response:** Determining a circuit's response to varying frequencies by setting up AC sources, defining frequency ranges, and analyzing frequency response plots.

# üíª How to Use Git and GitHub

First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

> Note: If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.
> 
>  You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
>  
>  For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/Simulation
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.
